üëã Welcome to my Home Operations repository. This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

### :handshake: Thanks

This cluster comes from the people who have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the awesome [Kubesearch](http://kubesearch.dev) tool for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.

There is a template over at [onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template) if you want to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.
