üëã Welcome to my Home Operations repository. This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

My Kubernetes cluster is deployed with [Talos](https://www.talos.dev). This is a semi-hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server with for NFS shares, bulk file storage and backups.

- [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager): Creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster.
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): Kubernetes CNI.
- [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared): Enables Cloudflare secure access to my routes.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically syncs ingress DNS records to a DNS provider.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [aKeyless](https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/kubernetes-plugins).
- [k8s-gateway](https://github.com/k8s-gateway/k8s_gateway): CoreDNS plugin to support internal ingress records.
- [nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx): Ingress controller and reverse proxy.
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops): Managed secrets for Kubernetes which are commited to Git.
- [spegel](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel): Stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror.
- [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller): Automatic Kubernetes and Talos upgrades.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

### Observability

- [alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager): Handles processing and sending alerts.
- [fluent-bit](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit): Log processor.
- [gatus](https://github.com/TwiN/gatus): High level status dashboard.
- [grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana): Data visualization platform.
- [karma](https://github.com/prymitive/karma): Alertmanager dashboard, based on Cloudflare's unsee.
- [keda](https://github.com/kedacore/keda): Autoscales containers depending on event (i.e. NFS share is down)
- [kromgo](https://github.com/kashalls/kromgo): Expose prometheus metrics "safely" to GitHub.
- [ntfy](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy): Handles receiving alerts on my devices.
- [silence-operator](https://github.com/giantswarm/silence-operator): Manages Alertmanager silences via custom resources.

### :handshake: Thanks

This cluster comes from the people who have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the awesome [Kubesearch](http://kubesearch.dev) tool for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.

There is a template over at [onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template) if you want to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.
